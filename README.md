# Black swans in ecological time series

This repository holds code for an analysis of heavy-tailed global population dynamics. This analysis is for a PhD thesis chapter and paper by Sean Anderson, Trevor Branch, Andy Cooper, and Nick Dulvy.

The analysis can be run by sourcing the `.R` files in sequence (`1-...R`, `2-...R`, etc.).
