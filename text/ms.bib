@Article{	  thibaut2012,
  abstract	= {Biodiversity may provide insurance against ecosystem
		  collapse by stabilizing assemblages that perform particular
		  ecological functions (the "portfolio effect"). However, the
		  extent to which this occurs in nature, and the importance
		  of different mechanisms that generate portfolio effects,
		  remains controversial. On coral reefs, herbivory helps
		  maintain coral dominated states, so volatility in levels of
		  herbivory has important implications for reef ecosystems.
		  Here we use an extensive time series of abundances on 35
		  reefs of the Great Barrier Reef of Australia to quantify
		  the strength of the portfolio effect for herbivorous
		  fishes. Then, we disentangle the contributions of two
		  mechanisms that underlie it: compensatory interactions, and
		  differential responses to environmental fluctuations
		  ("response diversity"), by fitting a community-dynamic
		  model than explicitly includes terms for both mechanisms.
		  We find that portfolio effects operate strongly in
		  herbivorous fishes, as shown by nearly independent
		  fluctuations in abundances over time. Moreover, we find
		  strong evidence for high response diversity, with nearly
		  independent responses to environmental fluctuations. In
		  contrast, we found little evidence that the portfolio
		  effect in this system was enhanced by compensatory
		  ecological interactions. Our results show that portfolio
		  effects are driven principally by response diversity for
		  herbivorous fishes on coral reefs. We conclude that
		  portfolio effects can be very strong in nature, and that,
		  for coral reefs in particular, response diversity on coral
		  reefs may help maintain herbivory above the threshold
		  levels that trigger regime shifts.},
