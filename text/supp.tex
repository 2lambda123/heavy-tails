\section{Data selection}

We applied the following data selection and quality-control rules to the
Global Population Dynamics Database (GPDD):

\begin{enumerate}

\item To remove populations with unreliable population indices that could be
  strongly confounded with economics and sampling effort, we removed all
  populations with a sampling protocol listed as \texttt{harvest} as well
  populations with the words \texttt{harvest} or \texttt{fur} in the cited
  reference title.

\item We removed all populations with uneven sampling intervals, i.e.\ we
  removed populations that did not have a constant difference between the
  ``decimal year begin'' and ``decimal year end'' columns.

\item We removed all populations rated as $< 2$ in the GPDD quality assessment
  (on a scale of $1$ to $5$, with $1$ being the lowest quality data)
  \citep[following][]{sibly2005, ziebarth2010}.

\item Populations with negative abundance values were removed. Of the
  populations that remained at the end of our other filtering rules, the
  remaining populations with negative abundances listed were all from time
  series that had been standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the
  standard deviation. We verified this by locating the original papers the
  datasets were extracted from: \citet{colebrook1978} for zooplankton and
  \citet{lindstrom1995} for grouse. Since the papers did not include the
  original mean time-series values we could not back transform these data
  points.

\item We filled in all missing time steps with \texttt{NA} values and imputed
  single missing values with the geometric mean of the previous and following
  values. We chose a geometric mean to be linear on the log scale that the
  Gompertz and Ricker-logistic models were fit on.

\item We filled in single recorded values of zero with the lowest non-zero
  value in the time series \citep[following][]{brook2006a}. This assumes that
  single values of zero result from abundance being low enough that censusing
  overlooked individuals that were actually present. We turned multiple zero
  values in a row into \texttt{NA} values. This implies that multiple zero
  values were either censusing errors or caused by emigration. Regardless, our
  population models were fit on a multiplicative (log) scale and so could not
  account for zero abundance. To avoid distorting the original data too
  strongly, we removed populations in which we filled in more than four zeros.

\item We removed all populations without at least four unique values
  \citep[following][]{brook2006a}.

\item We removed all populations with four or more identical values in a row
  since these suggest either recording error or extrapolation between two
  observations.

\item We then wrote an algorithm to find the longest unbroken window of
  abundance (no \texttt{NA}s) with at least $20$ time steps in each population
  time series. If there were any populations with multiple windows of identical
  length, we took the most recent window. This is a longer window than used in
  some previous analyses \citep[e.g.][]{brook2006a}, but since our model
  attempts to capture the shape of the distribution tails, our model requires
  more data.

\item We removed GPDD Main IDs \texttt{20531} and \texttt{10139}, which we
  noticed were duplicates of \texttt{20579} (a heron population).
  \texttt{20579} contained additional years of data not present in
  \texttt{10139}. We removed a limited number of populations from class
  Angiospermopsida and Bacillariophyceae to focus the taxonomy in our analysis
  on animals. We also removed any populations with an \texttt{Unknown}
  taxonomic class.

\item Finally, we removed populations with the following GPDD Main IDs, which
  we discovered were data entry errors when verifying the populations with
  suspected black swans: \texttt{1207} because the 1957 data point was entered
  as 2 but should have been 27 \citep{kendeigh1982}, \texttt{6531} because the
  1978 data point was entered as 7 but should have been 47 \citep{minot1986},
  and \texttt{6566} because some of the data did not match the graph
  \citep{heessen1996}.

\end{enumerate}

\noindent
%We provide a supplemental figure of all the time series included in our
%analysis and indicate which values were interpolated (non-zero interpolations)
\percImputedPops\% of populations had at least one point interpolated but
only \percImputedPoints\% of the total observations were interpolated.
We note that interpolation is highly unlikely to lead to
black-swan detections, since black swans involve extreme increases or
decreases.

\section{Implementation of the skewed Student-t distribution in Stan}

The probability density for the skewed Student-t distribution \citep{fernandez1998} equates to the following probability density as implemented in \citet{king2012}:

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{Skewed\,Student\mhyphen t}(x) =
\begin{dcases}
\frac{2}{(\gamma + 1/\gamma)}
         \mathrm{Student\mhyphen t}(x \cdot \gamma, \nu, \mu \cdot \gamma, \sigma),& \text{for } x < 0\\
       \frac{2}{(\gamma + 1/\gamma)}
         \mathrm{Student\mhyphen t}(x / \gamma, \nu, \mu / \gamma, \sigma),& \text{for } x \ge 0
\end{dcases}
\end{equation}

Here $\gamma$ represents the skewness parameter. The Student-t($\cdot$) portion represents in order: the data point of interest, the heavy-tailedness parameter, the location parameter, and the scale parameter as passed to the standard Student-t probability density. This translates to the log probability density:

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Skewed\,Student\mhyphen t}(x) =
\begin{dcases}
  \log (2 \gamma) - \log(\gamma^2 + 1) +
  \log \mathrm{Student\mhyphen t}(x \cdot \gamma, \nu, \mu \cdot \gamma, \sigma),& \text{for } x < 0\\
  \log (2 \gamma) - \log(\gamma^2 + 1) +
  \log \mathrm{Student\mhyphen t}(x / \gamma, \nu, \mu / \gamma, \sigma),& \text{for } x \ge 0
\end{dcases}
\end{equation}

Since Stan only needs the probability density up to an additive
constant \citep{stan-manual2014}, we
can replace $\log(2 \gamma)$ in the above for $\log(\gamma)$. The final log
probability density for the skewed Student's t distribution implemented in
Stan\footnote{Credit to Stan developer Bob Carpenter:
\url{https://groups.google.com/d/msg/stan-users/jeZQnQRUsDs/BeqhicWm1GEJ}}
looks like the following:

\begin{verbatim}
real skew_student_t_log(real y, real nu, real mu, real sigma, real skew) {
  real lp;
  lp <- log(skew) - log1p(square(skew));
  if (y < mu)
    return lp + student_t_log(y * skew, nu, mu * skew, sigma);
  else
    return lp + student_t_log(y / skew, nu, mu / skew, sigma);
}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Heavy-tailed Gompertz model simulations}

We separated our simulation into these two components to avoid confounding two
issues. (1) With smaller sample sizes, there may not be a stochastic draw from
the tails of a distribution. In that case, no model, no matter how perfect,
will be able to detect the shape of the tails. (2) Complex models may return
biased parameter estimates if there are conceptual, computational, or coding
errors. Our first simulation tested the first issue and our second simulation
tested the latter. In general, our simulations show that, if anything, our
model under predicts the magnitude and probability of heavy tailed
events---especially given the length of the time series in the GPDD.

First, we tested the ability to estimate $\nu$ given different true values of
$\nu$ and different sample sizes. We took stochastic draws from t
distributions with different $\nu$ values ($\nu = 3, 5, 10,$ and $10^6$
[$\approx$ normal]), with central tendency parameters of $0$, and scale
parameters of $1$. We started with $1600$ stochastic draws and then fit the
models again at the first $800, 400, 200, 100, 50,$ and $25$ draws. Each time
we recorded the posterior samples of $\nu$.

Second, we tested the ability of the heavy-tailed Gompertz model to obtain
unbiased parameter estimates when the process noise was chosen so that
appropriate tail events were present. To generate these process deviations for
the $\nu = 3$ and $\nu = 5$ scenarios, we repeatedly drew proposed candidate
process deviations and estimated the central tendency, scale, and $\nu$ values
each time. We recorded when $\hat{\nu}$ (median of the posterior) was within
$0.2$ CVs (coefficient of variations) of the true $\nu$ value and used this
set of random seed values in our Gompertz simulation.

The following pseudo R code illustrates the procedure to generate process
noise with effective $\nu$ values within a CV of 0.2 of the specified value
(the actual code is available at
\url{https://github.com/seananderson/heavy-tails}):

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
get_effective_nu_seeds <- function(nu_true = 5, cv = 0.2, N = 50, seed_N = 20) {
  # nu_true: The true nu value
  # cv:      The permitted effective nu coefficient of variation
  # N:       The length of time series
  # seed_N:  The number of seed values to generate
  seeds <- numeric(length = seed_N)
  seed_value <- 0
  for (i in seq_len(seed_N)) {
    nu_close <- FALSE
    while (!nu_close) {
      seed_value <- seed_value + 1
      set.seed(i)
      y <- rt(N, df = nu_true)
      sm <- rstan::stan(... # fit the Stan model here
      med_nu_hat <- median(rstan::extract(sm, pars = "nu")[[1]])
      if (med_nu_hat > (nu_true - cv) & med_nu_hat < (nu_true + cv)) {
        nu_close <- TRUE
        seeds[i] <- seed_value
      }
    }
  }
  seeds
}
nu_3_seeds_N50 <- get_effective_nu_seeds(nu_true = 3)
nu_5_seeds_N50 <- get_effective_nu_seeds(nu_true = 5)
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

We then fit our Gompertz models to the simulated datasets with all parameters
(except $\nu$) set near the median values estimated in the GPDD. We repeated
this with $50$ and $100$ samples without observation error, $50$ samples with
observation error ($\sigma_\mathrm{obs} = 0.2$), and $50$ samples with the
same observation error and a Gompertz model that allowed for correctly
specified observation error magnitude. Our results indicate that the Gompertz
model can recapture the true value of $\nu$ when the process noise was chosen
so that appropriate tail events were present (Extended Data Fig.
5 upper panels). The addition of observation error caused the
model to tend to underestimate the degree of heavy-tailedness. Fitting a model
with correctly specified observation error did not make substantial
improvements to model bias (Extended Data Fig. 5).

When converting the posterior distributions of $\nu$ into Pr($\nu < 10$), the
models distinguished heavy and not-heavy tails reasonably well (Extended Data
Fig. 5 lower panels). Without observation error, and using a
probability of $0.5$ as a threshold, the model correctly classified all
simulated systems with normally distributed process noise as not heavy tailed.
The model would have miscategorized only one of $40$ simulations at $\nu = 5$
across simulated populations with $50$ or $100$ time steps (Extended Data Fig.
5, scenarios 1 and 2 in lower row, second panel from left).
The model would have correctly categorized all cases where the process noise
was not heavy tailed (Extended Data Fig. 5 bottom-right
panel) and all cases where $\nu = 3$ and there was not observation error. With
$0.2$ standard deviations of observation error, the model still categorized
\obsErrorNuFivePerc\% of cases as heavy tailed when $\nu = 5$ and all but one
case when $\nu = 3$. Allowing for observation error made little improvement to
the detection of heavy tails. Therefore, we chose to focus on the simpler
model without observation error in the main text, particularly given that the
true magnitude of observation error was unknown in the empirical data.
