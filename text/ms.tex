\section{Abstract}

Black swans are improbable events that nonetheless
occur---often with profound consequences. While physical extremes, such as
monsoons and heat waves, are widely studied and increasing in magnitude and
frequency, it remains unclear the extent to which ecological population numbers
buffer or suffer from such extremes. Here we estimate the frequency and
direction of black-swan events in \NPops\ animal populations, finding strong
evidence for their occurrence in \(\sim\)\overallBasePerc \% of populations.
Black-swan events occur most frequently for birds (\birdPH \%), mammals
(\mammalsPH \%), and insects (\insectsPH \%),
manifest primarily as
population die-offs and crashes (\percBSDown \%) rather than unexpected increases,
and tend to be driven by extrinsic perturbations
such as climate, severe winters, or disease.
Thus, ignoring black-swan events will
underestimate extinction risk.
Our results demonstrate the importance of both
modeling heavy-tailed downward events in populations, and developing
conservation strategies that are robust to ecological surprises.
% Ignoring black-swan events leads to a \crashUnderMedian-fold (50\% interval \crashUnderRange) underestimate in the magnitude of population crashes.

% \textbf{One Sentence Summary}: Black swans---statistically improbable events
% with profound consequences---occur in animal populations and understanding
% them will improve climate risk assessments.

\section{Introduction}

Major surprises happen more often than expected in
financial, social, and natural systems \citep{taleb2007, sornette2009, may2008}.
Massive unpredictable market swings are responsible for the majority of
financial gains and losses \citep{taleb2007}, fatalities from the largest wars
dwarf those from all others  \citep{newman2005}, and the frequency of the most
damaging earthquakes has exceeded past expectations \citep{sornette2009}. In
ecological systems, background rates of global extinction are punctuated by
mass extinction \citep{harnik2012}, viruses can mutate suddenly to infect new
hosts, and billions of animals can die at once in mass mortality
events \citep{fey2015}.

Indeed, such die-offs may be the most important element
affecting population persistence \citep{mangel1994} and their importance is
likely to increase given projected increases in the frequency and magnitude of
climate-related extremes \citep{ipcc2012}.
% Despite this anecdotal evidence for
% ecological black swans, systematic searches of large numbers of timeseries have
% yet to reveal black-swan events \citep{keitt1998, allen2001, halley2002}.
However, the overwhelming majority of population model fitting and risk forecasting
assumes that deviations from model predictions can be represented by a normal
distribution \citep[on a log scale; e.g.][]{brook2006a, knape2012}.
If black swans occur, though, a normal distribution would under-estimate the
probability of extreme events occurring \citep{taleb2007}.

Whereas there are many reports of black-swan events,
only a flexible comparative approach consistently applied
to a large number of time series can yield insights into the frequency, strength,
and correlates of black-swan events.
We are unaware of such a comparative analysis.
Previous comparative analyses fitting
heavy-tailed distributions
(distributions with higher probabilities of extreme events
than the normal distribution)
to time series
have not accounted for an underlying population dynamics model
\citep{keitt1998, allen2001, halley2002, segura2013}.
Alternatively, most examples of population die offs come from identifying
sudden changes in abundance that exceed a chosen threshold of decline
\citep[e.g.][]{young1994, gerber2001, reed2003, fey2015}.
But this approach
does not distinguish events from
expected dynamics.
For instance, the range of natural variability 
can differ dramatically across taxa. 

Here, we develop a new approach to estimate the frequency and magnitude of
black-swan dynamics across time series of 609 populations from a wide array of
taxonomic groups---including many  birds, mammals, insects, and fishes
(Table~S1). We identify characteristics of time series or
life-history traits associated with the detection of black-swan events and
verify known causes. To accomplish this, we develop a framework for identifying
heavy-tailed (black-swan) process noise in population dynamics.
We test if the largest stochastic jumps in log abundance from one time step to the next
are more extreme than typically seen with a normal distribution. Our framework
allows for a range of population dynamic models, can incorporate observation
uncertainty and skewness in process noise, and can be readily applied to
abundance time series.

\section{Methods}

We fit population dynamics models in which the process noise is
drawn from a Student-$t$ distribution. By estimating the degrees of freedom
parameter, \(\nu\), we can estimate the degree to which the process deviations
have heavy tails and are therefore diagnostic of black-swan events (Fig.~1).
Lower values of \(\nu\) result in heavy-tailed distributions.
% For example, at \(\nu = 2\), an event
% more than 4 standard deviations below the mean is expected
For example, an event four standard deviations below the mean
is expected to happen once every 35 years with a $t$ distribution at \(\nu = 2\)
compared to once every 32,000 years with a normal distribution.
% more than four standard deviations below the mean is almost 70,000 times higher
% than the probability of drawing such a value from a normal distribution
% (\(0.02\) vs.\ \(2.9\cdot10^{-7}\)).
As \(\nu\) approaches infinity, the t
distribution approaches the normal distribution (Fig.~1).

We chose the $t$ distribution for a number of reasons.
Pragmatically, the $t$ distribution requires the estimation of only one additional
parameter over the normal distribution and reverts to the normal distribution
if strong evidence of heavy-tailed process deviations is not present.
Furthermore, the $t$ distribution arises from a mixture of normal distributions
with the same mean and different variances \citep{gelman2014},
which mimics the underlying basis for black-swan events.
There are a wide range of mechanistic processes
that could give rise to extreme events in population dynamics,
such as extreme climate events
\citep{meehl2004, katz2005, ipcc2012}
or sudden changes in predation from other species.
While evaluating these various hypotheses
would be important for diagnosing the underlying causes
of extreme events and to develop predictive models,
it would be impossible to tease out each of these
underlying causes from population trend data alone.
Instead we seek a simple flexible phenomenological model
that can be applied across the widest possible
range of population time series to provide a
comparative overview of the prevalence
of black-swan events.

One alternative approach would involve fitting
the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution,
which represents the limit distribution of a series of maxima or minima.
Although the GEV is well-suited for physical ecological variables
\citep[e.g.\ sedimentation rates or wind speeds;][]{gaines1993, denny2009},
the GEV requires maxima per time block
or peaks beyond a chosen threshold.
Therefore, the GEV requires longer time series then typically available
for wild animal population abundance.
Furthermore, the GEV approach cannot be easily integrated into population dynamics models.

% This could represent the effect of unmodeled spatial heterogeneity,
% nonstationary environmental processes, or
% varying responses to temperature among individuals, for example.

\subsection{Data}

We selected abundance time series from the Global Population Dynamics
Database \citep[GPDD,][]{gpdd2010}, which contains nearly 5,000 time series of
abundance from \(\sim\) 1,000 species and \(\sim\) 100 taxonomic orders. We
filtered the data (Supporting Information) to remove populations from less
reliable data sources, and those without sufficient data for our models, and
then interpolated remaining missing values (sensu \citet{brook2006a}).
Our interpolation affected only \(\sim\)
\interpPointsPerc \% of the final data points (Table~S1) and none of the data
points that were later considered black-swan events. Our final dataset
contained \NPops\ populations across \NOrders\ taxonomic orders and seven
taxonomic classes, with a median of \medianTimeSteps\ time steps (range
\minTimeSteps--\maxTimeSteps) (Table~S1).

\subsection{Modeling framework}

We fit heavy-tailed Gompertz population dynamics models to data from the GPDD.
The Gompertz model represents population growth as a linear function in
log space (here and throughout we use log
to refer to the natural logarithm).
If \(x_{t}\) represents the log abundance (\(N\)) at time \emph{t} then
\begin{align}
x_t &= \lambda + bx_{t - 1} + \epsilon_t\\
\epsilon_t &\sim \mathrm{Studen}t\mhyphen t(\nu, 0, \sigma)
\end{align}
The parameter \(\lambda\) represents the expected growth rate if \(N_{t}
= 1\). The model is density independent if \(b = 1\), maximally density
dependent if \(b = 0\), and inversely density dependent if \(b < 0\). Usually,
the process noise \(\epsilon_{t}\) is modelled as normally distributed, but we
allow it to be drawn from a Student-$t$ distribution with scale parameter
\(\sigma\) and degrees of freedom \(\nu\). We can then estimate the degree to
which the process deviations have heavy tails and are therefore evidence of
black-swan events (Fig.~1A, B).

For the Gompertz model, our weakly-informative priors (Fig.~S\ref{fig:priors}) were:
\begin{align}
b &\sim \mathrm{Uniform}(-1, 2)\\
\lambda &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(0, 10^2)\\
\sigma &\sim \mathrm{Half\mhyphen Cauchy} (0, 2.5)\\
\nu &\sim \mathrm{Truncated\mhyphen Exponential}(0.01, \mathrm{min.} = 2).
\end{align}
Our prior on \(b\) was uninformative between values of \(-1\) and \(2\). We
would not expect values of \(b\) with levels of density dependence as low as
\(-1\) (very strong inverse density dependence), nor would we generally expect
values above \(1\). We allowed values of \(b\) above \(1\) to allow for
non-stationary time series of growth rates. The estimates of \(b\) were well
within these bounds. Our prior on \(\lambda\) was weakly informative within the
range of expected values for population growth and is similar to the default
priors suggested by \citet{gelman2008d} for intercepts of
regression models. Our half-Cauchy prior on \(\sigma\) follows
\citet{gelman2006c} and \citet{gelman2008d} and the specific scale parameter of
\(2.5\) is based on our expected range of the value in nature from previous
studies \citep[e.g.][]{connors2014}. In our testing of a subsample of populations, our
parameter estimates were not qualitatively changed by switching to a uniform
prior on \(\sigma\), but the weakly informative half-Cauchy prior sped up chain
convergence.

We chose a weakly informative exponential prior on \(\nu\) with rate parameter
of \(0.01\) truncated at values above two---a slightly less informative prior
than suggested by \citet{fernandez1998}. We truncated the
distribution at \(2\), since at \(\nu < 2\) the variance of the $t$ distribution
is undefined. This prior gives only a \(7.7\)\% probability that \(\nu < 10\)
but constrains the sampling sufficiently to avoid \(\nu\) drifting towards infinity. In
any case, for \(\nu > 20\) the $t$ distribution is almost indistinguishable from
the normal distribution (Fig.~1). Based on the shape of the $t$ distribution, we
chose the probability that \(\nu < 10\), Pr(\(\nu < 10\)), to define the
probability of heavy-tailed (black-swan) dynamics. When categorizing a population as heavy
tailed, we applied a 0.5 probability threshold. In the scenario where the data
are uninformative about heavy tails (e.g.~Fig.~1E, H), the posterior for
\(\nu\) will approximately match the prior (prior median \(= 71\), mean \(=
102\)) and a metric of Pr\((\nu < 10) > 0.5\) will not flag the
population as heavy tailed.

We fit our models with Stan 2.6.0 \citep{stan-manual2015, hoffman2014}, and R
3.2.0 \citep{r2015}. We began with four chains and 2,000 iterations, discarding
the first 1,000 as warm up (i.e.~4,000 final samples). If \(\hat{R}\) (the
potential scale reduction factor---a measure of chain convergence) was greater
than \(1.05\) for any parameter, or if the minimum effective sample size,
\(n_\mathrm{eff}\) (a measure of the effective number of uncorrelated samples),
for any parameter was less than \(200\), we doubled both the total iterations
and warm up period and sampled from the model again. These thresholds are in
excess of the minimums recommended by \citet{gelman2006a} of
\(\hat{R} < 1.1\) and \(n_\mathrm{eff} > 100\) for reliable point estimates and
confidence intervals. In the majority of cases our minimum thresholds were
greatly exceeded. We continued this procedure up to 8,000 iterations (16,000
total samples) by which all chains had sufficiently converged.
The No-U-Turn Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler in Stan generally
requires fewer iterations to obtain equivalent effective sample sizes than the
Gibbs or Metropolis--Hastings algorithms \citep{stan-manual2015}.

\subsection{Alternative priors}

To test if the prior on \(\nu\) influenced our estimate of black-swan dynamics,
we refit our models with weaker and stronger priors. Our base model used a
prior on \(\nu\) of Truncated-Exponential(0.01, min.\ = 2). For a weaker prior
we used Truncated-Exponential(0.005, min.\ = 2) and for a stronger prior we
used Truncated-Exponential(0.02, min.\ = 2) (Fig.~S\ref{fig:priors}c). Note that
the base and weaker priors are relatively flat within the region of \(\nu <
20\), which is the region we are concerned about when categorizing
populations as heavy tailed. We also considered using a Uniform(\(0, 1\))
prior on \(1/\nu\) as used in \citet[][p.~443]{gelman2014}, but this
prior puts considerably more weight on lower (heavy-tailed) values of \(\nu\)
than the truncated exponential priors considered here,
and the results are therefore not shown.

\subsection{Alternative population models} We fit alternative population models to
test if four key phenomena changed our conclusions.

\subsubsection{Autocorrelated residuals} We considered a version of the Gompertz
model in which an autoregressive parameter was fit to the process-noise
residuals:
\begin{align}
x_t &= \lambda + b x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t\\
\epsilon_t &\sim \mathrm{Student}\mhyphen t(\nu, \phi \epsilon_{t-1}, \sigma).
\end{align}
In addition to the parameters in the original Gompertz model, this model
estimates an additional parameter \(\phi\), which represents the correlation of
subsequent residuals. Based on the results of previous analyses with the
GPDD \citep{connors2014} and the chosen prior in previous
analyses \citep{thorson2014a}, we placed a moderately informative prior on
\(\phi\) that assumed the greatest probability density near zero with the
reduced possibility of \(\phi\) being near \(-1\) or \(1\). Specifically, we
chose \(\phi \sim \mathrm{truncated\mhyphen Normal}(0, 0.5, \mathrm{min.} = -1,
\mathrm{max.} = 1)\).

\subsubsection{Density independence} We fit a simplified version of the
Gompertz model in which the density dependence parameter \(b\) was fixed at
\(1\) (density independent). This is equivalent to fitting a random walk model
(with drift) to the \(\log\) abundances or assuming the growth rates are drawn
from a stationary distribution. The model was as follows:
\begin{align}
x_t &= \lambda + x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t\\
\epsilon &\sim \mathrm{Student}\mhyphen t(\nu, 0, \sigma).
\end{align}
We fit this model for three reasons: (1) it is computationally simpler and so
provides a check that our more complicated full Gompertz model was obtaining
reasonable estimates of \(\nu\), (2) it provides a test of whether density
dependence was affecting our perception of heavy tails, (3) it
matches how some previous authors have modelled heavy tails without accounting
for density dependence \citep{segura2013}.

\subsubsection{Observation error} Observation error can bias parameter
estimates \citep{knape2012} and is known to affect the ability to detect extreme
events \citep{ward2007}. In our main analysis, we fit a model that ignored
observation error. One way to account for observation error would be to fit a
full state-space model that simultaneously estimates the magnitude of process
noise and observation error. However, simultaneously estimating observation and
process noise is a challenging problem (e.g.\ because the observation and
process noise parameters tend to negatively covary in model fitting) and is
known to sometimes result in identifiability issues with the Gompertz
population model \citep{knape2008}. Furthermore, our model was applied to
hundreds of time series, often of short length (as few as \minTimeSteps\ time
steps) and our model estimates an additional parameter---the shape of the
process deviation tails---potentially making identifiability and computational
issues even greater. Therefore, we considered a version of the base Gompertz
model that allowed for a fixed level of observation error:
\begin{align}
U_t &= \lambda + b U_{t-1} + \epsilon_t\\
x_t &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(U_t, \sigma_\mathrm{obs}^2)\\
\epsilon_t &\sim \mathrm{Student}\mhyphen t(\nu, 0, \sigma_\mathrm{proc}),
\end{align}
where \(U\) represents the served state vector, \(\sigma_\mathrm{obs}\)
represents the standard deviation of observation error (on a log scale), and
\(\sigma_\mathrm{proc}\) represent the process noise scale parameter. We set
\(\sigma_\mathrm{obs}\) to \(0.2\), which represents a typical value used in
simulation analyses \citep[e.g.][]{valpine2002, thorson2014b}.

\subsubsection{Ricker-logistic} We also fit a Ricker-logistic model:
\begin{align}
x_t &= x_{t-1} + r_{\mathrm{max}}\left(1 - \frac{N_{t-1}}{K}\right) + \epsilon_t\\
\epsilon_t &\sim \mathrm{Student}\mhyphen t(\nu, 0, \sigma),
\end{align}
where \(r_\mathrm{max}\) represents the theoretical maximum population growth
rate that is obtained when \(N_t = 0\). The parameter \(K\) represents the
carrying capacity and, as before, \(x_t\) represents the \(\log\) transformed
abundance at time \(t\). The Ricker-logistic model assumes a linear decrease in
population growth rate with increases in abundance. In contrast, the Gompertz
model assumes a linear decrease in population growth rate with increases in
\textit{log} abundance.

To fit the Ricker-logistic models, we chose a prior on \(K\) uniform between
zero and twice the maximum observed abundance (similar and less informative
than in \citet{delean2013}). We set the prior on
\(r_\mathrm{max}\) as uniform between 0 and 20 as in \citet{delean2013}. We used the same priors on \(\nu\) and \(\sigma\) as in
the Gompertz model.

\subsection{Simulation testing}
We performed two types of simulation testing.
First, we tested how easily the Student-$t$ distribution \(\nu\) parameter could
be recovered given different true values of \(\nu\) and different sample sizes.
Second, we tested the ability of the heavy-tailed Gompertz model to obtain
unbiased parameter estimates of \(\nu\) given that a set of process deviations
was provided in which the effective \(\nu\) value was close to the true \(\nu\)
value.

We found that we could consistently and precisely recover median posterior
estimates of \(\nu\) near the true value of \(\nu\) with large samples (\(\ge
200\)) (Fig.~S\ref{fig:sim-nu} upper panels). At smaller samples we could
usually qualitatively distinguish heavy from not-heavy tails, but the model
tended to underestimate how heavy the tails were. At the same time, at smaller
sample sizes, the model tended to overestimate how large the scale parameter
was (Fig.~S\ref{fig:sim-nu} lower panels).

Our simulation-testing results indicate that the Gompertz model can recapture
the true value of \(\nu\) when the process noise was chosen so that appropriate
tail events were present (Fig.~S\ref{fig:sim-prob} upper panels). The addition
of observation error caused the model to tend to underestimate the degree of
heavy-tailedness. Fitting a model with correctly specified observation error
did not substantially reduce model bias (Fig.~S\ref{fig:sim-prob}).

\subsection{Covariates of heavy-tailed dynamics} We fit a hierarchical beta
regression model to the predicted probability of heavy tails, Pr(\(\nu < 10\)),
to investigate potential covariates of heavy-tailed dynamics. We obtained
maximum lifespan and body-size data from \citet{brook2006a}.
Beta regression is useful when response data are on a continuous scale
between zero and one \citep[e.g.][]{ferrari2004}. The model was as follows:
\begin{align}
\mathrm{Pr}(\nu_i < 10) &\sim \mathrm{Beta}(A_i, B_i)\\
\mu_i &= \mathrm{logit}^{-1}(\alpha
  + \alpha^\mathrm{class}_{j[i]}
  + \alpha^\mathrm{order}_{k[i]}
  + \alpha^\mathrm{species}_{l[i]}
  + \bm{X_i} \bm{\beta}),
  \: \text{for } i = 1, \dots, 609\\
A_i &= \phi_\mathrm{disp} \mu_i\\
B_i &= \phi_\mathrm{disp} (1 - \mu_i)\\
\alpha^\mathrm{class}_j &\sim
  \mathrm{Normal}(0, \sigma^2_{\alpha \; \mathrm{class}}),
  \: \text{for } j = 1, \dots, 6\\
\alpha^\mathrm{order}_k &\sim
  \mathrm{Normal}(0, \sigma^2_{\alpha \; \mathrm{order}}),
  \: \text{for } k = 1, \dots, 38\\
\alpha^\mathrm{species}_l &\sim
  \mathrm{Normal}(0, \sigma^2_{\alpha \; \mathrm{species}}),
  \: \text{for } l = 1, \dots, 301,
\end{align}
where \(A\) and \(B\) represent the beta distribution shape parameters;
\(\mu_i\) represents the predicted value for population \(i\), class \(j\),
order \(k\), and species \(l\); \(\phi_\mathrm{disp}\) represents the
dispersion parameter; and \(\bm{X_i}\) represents a vector of predictors (such as
lifespan) for population \(i\) with associated \(\bm{\beta}\) coefficients. The
intercepts are allowed to vary from the overall intercept \(\alpha\) by
taxonomic class (\(\alpha^\mathrm{class}_j\)), taxonomic order
(\(\alpha^\mathrm{order}_k\)), and species (\(\alpha^\mathrm{species}_l\)) with
standard deviations \(\sigma_{\alpha \; \mathrm{class}}\), \(\sigma_{\alpha \;
\mathrm{order}}\), and \(\sigma_{\alpha \; \mathrm{species}}\). Where possible,
we also allowed for error distributions around the predictors by incorporating
the standard deviation of the posterior samples for the Gompertz parameters
\(\lambda\), \(b\), and \(\log \sigma\) around the mean point value as normal
distributions (not shown in the above equation).

We log transformed \(\sigma\), time-series length, and lifespan to match the
way they are visually represented in Fig.~S\ref{fig:correlates} and to make the
relationship approximately linear on the logit-transformed response scale. All
input variables were standardized by subtracting their mean and dividing by two
standard deviations to make their coefficients comparable in
magnitude \citep{gelman2008c}. We excluded body length as a covariate because it
was highly correlated with lifespan, and lifespan exhibited more overlap across
taxonomy than body length. Lifespan is also more directly related to time and
potential mechanisms driving black-swan dynamics.

We incorporated weakly informative priors into our model: \(\mathrm{Cauchy}(0,
10)\) on the global intercept \(\alpha\), \(\mathrm{half\mhyphen Cauchy}(0,
2.5)\) on all standard deviation parameters, \(\mathrm{half\mhyphen Cauchy}(0,
10)\) on the dispersion parameter \(\phi_\mathrm{disp}\), and
\(\mathrm{Cauchy}(0, 2.5)\) on all other parameters \citep{gelman2006c,
gelman2008d}. Compared to normal priors, the Cauchy priors concentrate more
probability density around expected parameter values while allowing for a
higher probability density far into the tails, thereby allowing the data to
dominate the posterior more strongly if it disagrees with the prior. We fit our
models with 5,000 total iterations per chain, 2500 warm-up iterations, four
chains, and discarding every second sample. We checked for chain convergence
visually and with the same criteria as before (\(\widehat{R} < 1.05\) and
\(n_\mathrm{eff} >200\) for all parameters). Furthermore, we checked our model
against a similar model with the glmmADMB \textsf{R} package \citep{glmmadmb}
without uncertainty around the predictors.

To derive taxonomic-order-level estimates of the probability of heavy tails
accounting for time-series length (Fig.~3A), we fit a separate hierarchical
model with the same structure but with only \(\log\) time-series length as a
predictor---in this case, we did not want to control for intrinsic population
characteristics such as density dependence. Since our predictors were centered
by subtracting their mean value, we obtained order-level estimates of the
probability of heavy tails at mean log time-series length by adding the
posteriors for \(\alpha\), \(\alpha^\mathrm{class}_j\), and
\(\alpha^\mathrm{order}_k\).

\subsection{Skewed Student-$t$ forecasts} To evaluate the apparent skewness
of heavy-tailed process noise we fit Gompertz models with skewed Student-$t$
distributed process noise \citep{fernandez1998}. This distribution adds one
parameter to the Student-$t$ distribution, \(\gamma\), which controls the
skewness. The distribution is symmetrical if \(\gamma = 1\), left skewed if \(0
< \gamma < 1\), and right skewed if \(1 < \gamma < \infty\). We placed a weakly
informative prior of \(\mathrm{Cauchy}(0, 2.5)\) on \(\log \gamma\). We
aggregated 5,000 randomly selected posterior samples from the \(\gamma\)
parameter of each model at three levels of evidence for heavy-tails:
\emph{heavy tailed}, median \(\nu < 10\); \emph{slightly heavy tailed}, \(10 \le
\mathrm{median}\, \nu \le 70\); and \emph{normal tailed}, median \(\nu > 70\)
(Fig.~4).

To generate five-year forecasts of abundance, we combined the posterior
parameter samples from the skewed-t Gompertz models with stochastically
generated process noise. We compared these forecasts to those generated by a
standard Gompertz model with normally distributed process noise fit to the same
data. We calculated the ratio of the lower 99\% quantile credible interval
between the two model projections for all populations in which Pr(\(\nu < 10\))
\(> 0.5\). To ensure the results had stabilized in the tails of the forecast
posterior, we increased the number of posterior samples in Stan. We ran four
chains of 20,000 iterations and discarded the first 10,000 as warmup for a
total of 40,000 samples.

\section{Results}

We found evidence that black-swan dynamics are infrequent but highly
influential: in our dataset they were detected most
frequently for birds (7\%), mammals (5\%), and
insects (3\%) but almost never in fishes (Fig.~2). Black-swan
events were taxonomically widespread, occurring in 38\% of taxonomic orders.
Accounting for time series length and partially pooling inference across
taxonomic class and order with a hierarchical model, we found stronger evidence
for black swans in insect populations than these statistics suggest---four of
eight orders with the highest median probability of heavy tails were insect
orders (Fig.~3a).

The majority of our heavy-tailed estimates were robust to alternative
population models, observation error, and choice of Bayesian priors. Our
conclusions were not systematically altered when we included autocorrelation
in the residuals, modelled population growth rates with or without
density dependence, or modelled the population dynamics as Ricker-logistic
instead of Gompertz (Fig.~S\ref{fig:alt}). Similarly, introducing moderate
observation error (CV = 0.2) only slightly decreased the estimated prevalence
of black-swan events (Fig.~S\ref{fig:alt}), and the strength of the prior on
\(\nu\) had little influence on estimates of black-swan dynamics
(Fig.~S\ref{fig:alt-priors}). Finally, our simulation testing shows that, if
anything, our models underpredict the true magnitude and probability of
heavy-tailed events---especially given that the time series are relatively short,
with a median of only 26
years in our analysis (Figs~S\ref{fig:sim-nu},~S\ref{fig:sim-prob}).

For model fits to the population data, the probability of detecting black-swan
dynamics was positively related to time-series length and negatively related to
magnitude of process noise but not clearly related to population growth rate,
density dependence, or maximum lifespan (Fig.~3b, Fig.~S\ref{fig:correlates}).
Longer time-series length was the strongest covariate of observing black-swan
dynamics: there is a 1.6 times greater probability of detecting a black-swan
event in populations with 60 time steps than in one with 30 time steps
(Fig.~S\ref{fig:correlates}).

The majority of black-swan events (\percBSDown \%) were downward (die-offs)
rather than upward (unexpectedly rapid abundance increases). Of the black-swan
events with published explanations (Table~S2), the majority involved
a combination of multiple factors. For example, a synchronization of
environmental- and predation-mediated population cycles is thought to have
caused a downward black-swan event for a water vole (\emph{Arvicola
terrestris}) population \citep{saucy1994}. Other black swans were the result of
a sequence of extreme climate events on their own. For instance, severe winters
in 1929, 1940--1942, and 1962--1963 were associated with black-swan downswings
in grey herons (\emph{Ardea cinerea}) in the United
Kingdom \citep{stafford1971} (Fig.~4c). Our analysis finds that the last event
was a combination of two heavy-tailed events in a row and the population took
three times longer to recover than predicted \citep{stafford1971}. Downward black
swans were sometimes followed by upward black swans. For example, during
a period of population crowding and nest shortages, a population of European
shag cormorants (\emph{Phalacrocorax aristotelis}) on the Farne Islands, United
Kingdom declined suddenly following a red tide event in 1968 \citep{potts1980}.
This freed up quality nest sites for first-time breeders, productivity
increased, and the population experienced a rapid upswing in
abundance \citep{potts1980}.

Given the prevalence of downwards events, we refit our heavy-tailed models to
measure the degree of skewness \(\gamma\) of the process noise using a skew-t
distribution (Fig.~4a), and used these models to make near-term risk forecasts.
Aggregated across populations with strong evidence of heavy tails (median \(\nu
< 10\)), 85\% of the \(\gamma\) probability density was below 1, indicating
strong evidence of downwardly skewed process noise (Fig.~4b,
Fig.~S\ref{fig:skew-nu}). In contrast, populations that did not have heavy
tails (median \(\nu \geq 70\)) had little evidence of skewed process noise
(Fig.~4b; 90\% of 95\% credible intervals overlapped 1). Projecting these
heavy-tailed populations forward five years revealed that assuming standard
normal process noise underestimated risk (99\% lower credible interval of
abundance) by \crashUnderRange-fold (interquartile range; Fig.~4c,
Fig.~S\ref{fig:skew-projections}).

\section{Discussion}

We systematically evaluated the presence of black-swan events in hundreds of
animal populations.
We find strong evidence for their occurrence in animal populations. Black-swan
population crashes are substantially more frequent
than black-swan population
increases and are usually driven by external events such as weather and
disease.
Thus our analysis provides strong evidence
for downward-skewed heavy-tailed events in abundance time series of higher
taxa, and ignoring these events will tend to underestimate the risk of
population declines.
Next we consider
(1) the possible mechanisms underlying black-swan events,
(2) caveats to our findings,
(3) the consequences of our findings for making risk forecasts, and
(4) for managing natural resources.

There are many possible causes of black-swan events, including
unmodelled intrinsic properties of populations or extrinsic forces acting on
populations. For example, we could observe black-swan dynamics if we miss an
underlying mixture of processes, since a mixture of normal distributions with
different variances can generate a $t$ distribution with heavy
tails \citep{gelman2014}. In ecology, these processes could arise through an
aggregation of populations across space, population
diversity \citep{schindler2010}, or an intrinsic change in population variability
through time \citep{carpenter2006}. Extrinsic ecological forces could also cause
black-swan dynamics \citep{nunez2012} including extreme climate
events \citep{meehl2004, katz2005, ipcc2012}, predation from (or competition
with) other species experiencing black-swan events, or sharp changes in human
pressures such as fishing or habitat destruction. Alternatively, the
synchrony of multiple extrinsic forces could give rise to black-swan dynamics
through synergistic interactions \citep{kirby2009} or a rare alignment of
non-synergistic forces \citep{denny2009}.

There are a number of caveats when considering the generality of our results.
The GPDD data represent a taxonomically and geographically biased sample of
populations---the longer time series we focused on are dominated by commercially
and recreationally important species and a disproportionate number of
populations are located in the United Kingdom. Although we would expect to find
qualitatively similar evidence for black swans in other large taxonomic or
geographic samples of populations, the common forces driving those black swans
would likely differ. Additionally, some apparent black-swan events could be
recording mistakes, although conversely, some extreme observations may have been
discarded or altered if they were erroneously suspected of being recording
mistakes. Indeed, we discarded three of the populations that our method
initially identified as heavy tailed because they turned out to be data-entry
errors. Finally, the temporal scales of observation and population dynamics
vary considerably across populations in the GPDD and these likely influence the
detection of heavy tails. For example, if we make frequent observations
relative to generation time (e.g.~for many large-bodied mammals) we will
average across generations and perhaps miss black-swan events. Conversely, if
we census populations infrequently relative to generation time (e.g.~many
insects in the GPDD) the recorded data may average across extreme and
less-extreme events and also dampen black-swan dynamics.

Given our results, we suggest modelers should routinely consider representing population dynamic
process noise with a heavy-tailed, and possibly downward-skewed, distribution,
especially when making forecasts to evaluate risk.
But what heavy-tailed distribution should one pick
and how heavy-tailed should it be?
% nearly any reason for why a population modeler has incorrectly specified the exact and full process generating the abundance times could generate a heavy tailed process noise.
This is an open research question.
The exact shape of the tails has proven important
in the field of dispersal biology \citep[e.g.][]{kot1996, clark1999}.
Answers for the field of population dynamics
might come from simulation analyses exploring
the implications of tail shapes and
from comparing the relative fit of heavy-tailed
population models to time series
with suspected mass mortality events
\citep[e.g.~the $t$ distribution compared to a mixture
of two normal distributions;][]{ward2007}.
Nevertheless, our proposed $t$ (or the skew-$t$) distribution
is a simple and elegant solution that
can be easily substituted for the normal distribution.
Furthermore, if the degrees of freedom parameter ($\nu$)
is fixed,
it requires estimating no more parameters
than the normal distribution.
Barring a better estimate,
we suggest using $\nu = 4$; and
a skewness parameter ($\gamma$) of $\sim 0.7$ (Fig.~4a)
if a modeler wishes to allow for downward heavy-tailed events.
These are midrange values from the populations identified as heavy tailed here.
Above $\nu  =  10$ the $t$ distribution closely resembles
the normal distribution,
and $\nu  = 4$ allows for an event
three standard deviations below the mean to happen
once every 50 years instead of once every 740 years.
Adopting heavy-tailed process noise by default follows the intuition
that our models are usually reasonable but occasionally very wrong.

In light of our findings, we suggest that natural resource management can
learn from disciplines that focus on heavy tails. For example, earthquake
preparedness and response is focused on black-swan events. Similarly to
ecological black swans, we can rarely predict the specific timing of large
earthquakes. But, earthquake preparedness involves spatial planning based on
forecast probabilities to focus early detection efforts and develop disaster
response plans \citep{nrc2007}. The presence of ecological black swans also suggests that we
develop management policy that is robust to heavy tails and encourages
general resilience \citep{carpenter2012}. For instance, setting target
population abundances far back from critical limits will buffer against black-swan
events \citep{caddy1996}, and maintaining genetic, phenotypic, and behavioural
diversity may allow some components of populations to persist when others are
affected by disease or extreme environmental forces \citep{schindler2010}.
Finally, surprising, or counterintuitive ecological dynamics offer a tremendous
opportunity to learn about ecological systems, evaluate when models break down,
and adjust future management policy \citep{doak2008, lindenmayer2010}.

Rare catastrophes can have a profound influence on population
persistence \citep{mangel1994}. In recent decades, ecology has moved toward
focusing on aspects of variance in addition to mean
responses \citep{thompson2013}. Our results suggest that an added focus on
ecological extremes represents the next frontier, particularly in the face of
increased climate extremes \citep{meehl2004, ipcc2012, thompson2013}. Financial
analysts are concerned with the shape of downward tails in financial returns
because these directly impact estimates of risk---the probability of a
market crash occurring.
Similarly, ecologists should focus more
on estimating and predicting downward tails of population abundance, since
these increase true extinction risk.
