drivers are unclear.

\section{Abstract}

Black swans are statistically improbable events that nonetheless occur ---
often with profound implications. While extremes in the physical
environment,such as monsoons and heat waves, are widely studied and increasing
in magnitude and frequency, it remains unclear the extent to which ecological
populations buffer or suffer from extremes. Here, we develop a probability
model to estimate the degree of heavy-tailedness (presence of black swans) in
ecological process noise. We apply our model to \NPops~time series from around
the world across \NOrders~taxonomic orders and seven classes. We find strong
evidence of black swans, but they are rare, occurring in
\overallMinPerc--\overallMaxPerc\%of populations; most frequently for birds
(\AvesRangePerc\%) followed by mammals (\MammaliaRangePerc\%), insects
(\InsectaRangePerc\%), and fishes(\OsteichthyesRangePerc\%). When they occur,
they tend to be driven by climate and severe winters, cycles of parasites and
predators, and interactions between these elements. They are more frequently
detected for populations with longer time series and lower levels of process
noise. We find little evidence of intrinsic life-history covariates. TODO close

\section{Introduction}

Black swans are unexpected extreme events with dramatic consequences
\citep{taleb2007,sornette2009}. One of the most striking black swans in ecology
was the asteroid marking the mass extinction of the K-T boundary (REF). Today,
it is the extremeness of climate, in concert with shifts in mean temperature,
that is expected to cause the greatest societal damage \citep{ipcc2012}.
However, whereas extremes in the physical environment such as wave height, rain
fall, and temperature are present and widely accepted
\citep{gaines1993,katz2005}, it remains unclear the extent to which ecological
systems buffer or suffer from black swans \citep{nunez2012}.

%Existing evidence for black swans or heavy tails in population dynamics is
%mostly anecdotal or for particular systems.
There is compelling anecdotal evidence for ecological black swans, and
quantitative evidence for a limited number of systems, but systematic evidence
has been elusive. For example, \citet{doak2008} reviewed a collection of field
experiment population dynamic surprises and conclude that these are more common
than we typically assume. \citet{nunez2012} compiled a list of major events on
geologic and contemporary scales that could be considered ecological black
swans. Other work has identified heavy-tail dynamics for particular systems.
For example, \citet{segura2013} identified heavy tails in time series of marine
microbe populations and \citet{drake2014} identified heavy tails in time to
extinction for experimental waterflea populations. However, systematic evidence
has been limited. \citet{keitt1998} tested for power-law tail distributions in
breeding bird abundance, but later worked showed the apparent heavy tails were
a result of mixing populations of different species \citep{allen2001}. A later
large scale analysis of the Global Population Dynamics Database (GPDD) by
\citet{halley2002} found little evidence for heavy-tail distributions in longer
abundance time series.

%Considerable work has focussed on heavy tails in physical environmental
%processes in, for example, rain fall (REF), wave height (REF), earth quake
%magnitude, climate temperature (REF). time to extinction, plankton time series,
%GPDD work found little evidence subsequent work suggested, but... Ward applied
%a data-intense method and found evidence for.

%Ecological population dynamic models typically assume 'thin tailed'
%distributions, such as the normal distribution on a multiplicative scale (e.g.
%REF). We define black swan dynamics as cases where jumps in population
%abundance from time step to time step. from heavy-tailed distributions.

There are two key reasons why we may find little evidence of ecological black
swans. First, they might not exist. Indeed, the majority of population dynamics
model fitting and risk forecasting assumes that population dynamics are not
heavy tailed (e.g.~REF, REF, REF). Alternatively, dynamics might be heavy
tailed, but a paucity of statistical methods for the frequently available short
time series has limited our ability to detect them. For example, a commonly
applied probability distribution to detect the shape of time series tails (the
generalized extreme value distribution) requires lumping data into the most
extreme event per unit time (e.g.~heaviest rainfall per year) and therefore
requires a considerable quantity of data (REF). Previous large-scale work on
the distribution of abundance trends focused on model comparison to identify
parsimonious descriptions, but has not quantified the magnitude of heavy tails
on a continuous scale (REF). Furthermore, information criteria are poor at
distinguishing subtle differences in population dynamics for the relatively
short time series that are most readily available (REF CHANGE THIS?).
%bring in Ward - great method but data intensive, can't be applied to most
%individual time series from the GPDD
%plankton --- hideous distribution to fit, even harder in population dynamics
%framework -and what about seasonal cycles, density dependence?
%GPDD - model competition and finding most parsimonious explanation from set of
%hypotheses --- but only \emph{very} heavy from not heavy
%GEV --- super data intensive
%tipping point and regime shift methods --- say something\ldots{} not
%appropriate for most of the data available

Here we develop a probabilist framework for identifying ecological black swans
in population dynamic process noise --- the stochastic jumps from time step to
time step. Our framework quantifies both the magnitude and probability of
heavy-tailed dynamics, allows for a range of population dynamic models, can
incorporate observation uncertainty, and is applicable to commonly available
lengths of abundance time series. We apply our model to hundreds of populations
from around the world across four taxonomic classes to address three questions:
(1) how frequent and strong are black swans in population dynamics across
taxonomy, (2) what are some verified causes of black swans in ecological time
series, and (3) are there characteristics of time series or intrinsic
life-history characteristics associated with heavy-tailed dynamics. We find
a high probability of ecological black swans across a wide range of taxa but in
a limited number of populations. When they occurred, extreme climate,
predation, parasites, and their interactions were common documented causes. We
found little evidence that intrinsic life-history characteristics were related
to the probability of black swans.

\section{Methods}

To obtain estimates of the probability and magnitude of black swans, we fitted
population dynamic models to hundreds of abundance time series from around the
world. The key addition of our models, compared to typical population models,
was estimating the shape of the process noise tails. We then compared how these
estimates related to taxonomy, time series properties, and life-history
characteristics, and for a subset of populations, we documented the established
causes of ecological black swans.

\subsection{Time-series data}

We obtained abundance time series from the Global Population Dynamics Database
(GPDD) \citep{gpdd2010}. The GPDD contains nearly 5000 time series of abundance
across $\sim$1000 species and $\sim$100 taxonomic orders. To derive
a high-quality subset of populations that were suitable for our analyses, we
filtered the data (Supporting Material). Our filtering removed populations from
less reliable data sources, removed those without sufficient data for our
models, and interpolated some missing values. Our final dataset contained
\NPops~populations across \NOrders~taxonomic orders and seven taxonomic classes
with a median of XX time steps (range of XX--XX) (Table S1,
Fig.~\ref{fig:all-ts}).

\subsection{Population models}

Our main analysis focuses on the commonly applied phenomenological Gompertz
population dynamics model. In previous analyses of the GPDD, the Gompertz has
proved to be the most frequently parsimonious model \citep{brook2006}. We
extended the traditional Gompertz model by allowing the process noise to be
drawn from a Student-t distribution with degrees of freedom parameter $\nu$
(Fig.~\ref{fig:didactic}). If $\nu$ is small ($\lesssim 10$) the t distribution
has much heavier tails than a normal distribution. For example, at $\nu = 2$,
the probability of drawing a value more than five standard deviations below the
mean is $1.8$\%, whereas the probability of drawing such a value from a normal
distribution is nearly zero ($2.9\cdot10^{-5}$\%). As $\nu$ approaches infinity
the distribution approaches the normal distribution. By estimating the value of
$\nu$ we can quantity how heavy-tailed the process noise deviations are
(Fig.~\ref{fig:didactic}).

The heavy-tailed Gompertz model is:
\begin{align*}
x_t &= \ln N_t\\
x_t &= \lambda + b x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t\\
\epsilon_t &\sim \mathrm{Student\mhyphen t}(\nu, 0, \sigma),
\end{align*}
where $x_t$ is the $\ln$ abundance ($N$) at time $t$. The model is density
independent if $b = 1$, maximally density dependent if $b = 0$, and inversely
density dependent if $b < 0$. The parameter $\lambda$ represents the expected
$\ln$ number of new individuals at time $t + 1$ if $N_t = 1$ (per capita
population growth rate). The process noise is modelled as a Student-t
distribution with degrees of freedom parameter $\nu$, a mean of $0$, and
a scale parameter of $\sigma$.

We chose weakly informative priors to incorporate our understanding of
plausible population dynamics \citep[Supporting Material]{gelman2014}. For
$\nu$, we chose an exponential prior with rate parameter of $0.01$ truncated at
values above two (Fig.~\ref{fig:priors}), a slightly less informative prior
than that suggested by \citet{fernandez1998}. This prior gives only a 7.7\%
probability that $\nu < 10$ but constrains the sampling sufficiently to avoid
wandering off towards infinity --- above approximately $\nu = 20$ the
t distribution is so similar to the normal distribution that time series of the
length considered here are unlikely to be informative about the precise value
of $\nu$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:didactic}).

We estimated all models in a Bayesian framework using Stan
\citep{stan-manual2014}. Stan samples from the posterior distribution with
a version of Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo called the No-U-Turn Sampler
\citep{hoffman2014}. We assured that chains had sufficiently converged and the
sampler had obtained sufficient independent samples from the posterior
($\widehat{R} < 1.05$, $n_\mathrm{eff} > 200$; Supporting Material). We used
simulated data to test how easily we could detect $\nu$ given different sample
sizes and to ensure we could recover unbiased parameter estimates from the
Gompertz model (Supporting Material, Fig.~\ref{fig:sim-nu},
\ref{fig:sim-gompertz}, \ref{fig:sim-gompertz-boxplots}).

We fit four alternative population models to test if they systematically
changed our conclusions. (1) Autocorrelation has been suggested as a reason for
increased observed variability of abundance time series through time, which
could create apparent heavy tails \citep{inchausti2002}; therefore, we fit
a model that modelled the serial correlation in the residuals. (2) Previous
work has focussed modelled growth rates without accounting for density
dependence \citep{segura2013}; therefore, we fit a simpler model in which we
assumed density independence. (3) Observation error could bias parameter
estimates \citep{knape2012} or mask our ability to detect heavy tails
\citep{ward2007}. However, simultaneously estimating observation error and
process noise in a state space framework is a challenging computational problem
\citep[e.g.][]{dennis2006, knape2008} even with longer time series and without
estimating the shape of the process error tails; therefore, we fit a model
where we assumed a level of observation error ($0.2$ standard deviations on
a log scale). (4) The Gompertz model assumes that population growth rate
declines linearly with log abundance. We also fit an alternative model, the
Ricker-logistic model, which assumes that population growth rate declines
linearly with abundance itself (Supporting Material).

\subsection{Covariates of population dynamic black swans}

We investigated possible covariates of heavy-tailed population dynamics
visually and through multilevel modelling. We plotted characteristics of the
time series ($\sigma$, $\lambda$, $b$, and time-series length) along with two
life-history characteristics (body length and maximum lifespan obtained from
\citet{brook2006a}) against our estimates of $\nu$. We formally investigated
these relationships by fitting beta regression multilevel models to the
probability that $\nu$ was less than $10$ (i.e.~approximately the probability
of heavy tails). For covariates that were derived from Gompertz model parameter
estimates, we incorporated standard deviations around the means. To account for
broad patterns of phylogenetic relatedness, we allowed for varying intercepts
at the taxonomic class, order, and species level (Supporting Material).

Finally, we investigated a sample of populations that our method categorized as
having a high probability of heavy tails (Pr$(\nu < 10) > 0.5$). Where
possible, we found the documented causes of ecological black swans in the
primary data source cited in the GPDD or in other literature describing the
population. These populations were chosen haphazardly with the purpose of
generating hypotheses about the causes of population dynamic black swans.

\section{Results}

We found strong but rare evidence for black-swan dynamics. Defining black-swan
dynamics as a greater than $0.5$ probability that $\nu < 10$, we observed black
swans most frequently for birds (X\%) followed by mammals (X\%), insects (X\%),
and fishes (X\%) (Fig.~\ref{fig:nu-coefs}, \ref{fig:heavy-ts}). Black swans
were taxonomically widespread, occurring for at least one population in X\% of
the taxonomic orders recorded. Accounting for time series length and partially
pooling inference across taxonomic class and order with a multilevel model,
there was stronger evidence for black swans in insect populations than is
apparent in Fig.~\ref{fig:nu-coefs} --- four of 10 orders with the highest
median probability of heavy tails were insect orders --- however, there was
considerable uncertainty in these estimates (Fig.~\ref{fig:order-estimates}).

The majority of our heavy-tailed estimates were robust to alternative
population models and observation error (Fig.~\ref{fig:alt}). Including an
autocorrelation structure in the residuals, modelling population growth rates
as a random walk with drift, or modelling the population dynamics as
Ricker-logistic did not systematically alter our conclusions. Allowing for
a fixed quantity of observation error decreased our estimates of black-swan
dynamics, increasing the median estimate of $\nu$ from $<10$ to $>10$ in X of
XX populations although the majority of $\nu$ estimates remained qualitatively
similar (Fig.~\ref{fig:alt})

Across populations, the probability of observing black swan dynamics was
positively related to time-series length and negatively related to magnitude of
process noise ($\sigma$) but not clearly related to population growth rate
($\lambda$), density dependence ($b$), or maximum lifespan
(Fig.~\ref{fig:correlates}, \ref{fig:correlate-coefs}). Longer time-series
length was the strongest covariate of observing black swan dynamics (as was
similarly observed in simulation testing, Fig.~\ref{fig:sim-nu}). For example,
we were about 15\% TODO more likely to observe heavy tails in a population with
40 time steps than in one with 30 time steps (Fig.~\ref{fig:perc-inc-p}).
However, the absolute change in probability with increased time series length
was small ($0.X$ vs. $0.X$ in the previous example, Fig.~\ref{fig:correlates}).

We assembled the documented causes of black swan population dynamics in seven
populations with high probabilities of heavy tails (Table 1). The majority of
documented events were downward black swans and the majority involved
a confluence of events. For example, a shortage of nest sites for the shag in
the UK was thought to reduce population productivity and make the population
vulnerable when a red-tide hit in 1968. The population experienced a black swan
downswing, but the new availability of nest sites resulted in a rapid
population upswing \citep{potts1980}. As another example, an interaction
between population cycles caused by predation combined with cycles caused by
the environment are thought to have caused a downward black swan for a water
vole population \citep{saucy1994}. Other black swans were the result of
a sequence of extreme climate events on their own. For example, severe winters
in 1929, 1940--1942, and 1962--1963 were associated with black swan downswings
in grey heron abundance in the UK \citep{stafford1971}. Our analysis finds that
the last event was a combination of two black swan events in a row and
population recovery took three times longer than predicted
\citep{stafford1971}.

\section{Discussion}

We found strong evidence that the multiplicative process noise jumps from time
step to time step were greater than we would expect under a normal distribution
and a Gompertz or Ricker-logistic model in XX--XX\% of populations assessed. We
detected black swans more frequently for longer time series and for populations
with a smaller magnitude of process error, as we might expect. However, we
failed to find strong evidence that black swans were associated with density
dependence, population growth rate, or lifespan. In cases that we verified,
black swans were often a result of the interaction between elements of extreme
climate, predators and parasite cycles, and strong changes in human pressures.
Our empirical results, sensitivity tests, and simulation tests suggest that
estimating the tail shape of process error is a viable method of detecting
heavy-tailed population dynamics. The presence of black swans highlights the
importance of developing management strategies that detect quickly, respond to,
and are robust to extremes in population dynamics --- particularly as the
frequency and magnitude of climatic extremes increase over the next century
(REF).

Our results clarify, but do not disagree with previous related analyses.
Previous work with an older version of the GPDD assessed the distribution of
abundance timeseries but focused on identifying if the lognormal distribution
was the most frequently parsimonious model \citep{halley2002}. For heavy-tailed
distributions, \citet{halley2002} fit the extremely heavy-tailed Cauchy
distribution and the four-parameter Levy stable distribution and found little
information criteria support for these distributions in longer time series.
However, black swan events are by definition rare, and the majority of time
series in the GPDD are short for these purposes. Therefore, we would not expect
to observe black swans in a large proportion of populations. Furthermore, by
probabilistically quantifying process noise tail behaviour on a continuous
spectrum, and allowing for non-stationary time series and density dependence,
our analysis allows for a more nuanced description of the evidence of
ecological black swans. In an earlier study, \citet{keitt1998} described heavy
(power law) tails in breeding bird population abundance. However, this finding
was challenged by \citet{allen2001}, who showed that mixing data across species
could create falsely generate heavy tails. This rebuttal supports our use of
the t distribution to represent heavy tails, since a t distribution can be
represented by a mixture of normal distributions \citep[with
inverse-gamma-distributed variances,][]{gelman2014}.

We might expect to observe black swan dynamics in ecological time series
because of unmodelled intrinsic properties of populations or extrinsic forces
acting on populations. Since a t-distribution can be formed by a mixture of
normal distributions, we could observe heavy tails if we miss some underlying
mixture of intrinsic processes \citep{allen2001}. That process might be an
aggregation of populations across space, or population diversity, or some
intrinsic change in population variability through time. Extrinsic forces could
also cause black swan dynamics (REF). These forces could be extreme themselves.
For example, extreme climate, predation from or competition with other species
experiencing black swans, or sharp changes in human pressure such hunting,
fishing, or habitat destruction might cause black swans (REFS). Alternatively,
the interaction of multiple ``normal'' extrinsic forces could give rise to
black swan ecological dynamics. This could occur if the interaction nature is
synergistic \citep[e.g.][]{kirby2009} or even if non-synergistic interactions
experience a rare alignment \citep{denny2009}.

There are a number of caveats when considering the generality of our results.
First, the GPDD data represent a taxonomically and geographically biased sample
of populations --- the longer time series we focus on are dominated by
commercially and recreationally important species and a disproportionate number
of populations are located in the United Kingdom. Although we expect that we
would find strong but rare evidence for black swans in other large taxonomic or
geographic samples, the common forces driving those black swans (e.g.~severe
winters in Table~1) likely differ. Second, in a large database with disparate
data sources, we cannot ensure the quality of every data point. Recording
mistakes undoubtedly comprise some of the black swans we detected. Conversely,
recording mistakes could mask heavy tails if initial observations assumed to be
recording errors and are discarded or altered. Third, the temporal scale of
observation and population dynamics vary considerably across populations in the
GPDD and this likely influences the detection of heavy tails. For example, if
we make frequent observations relative to generation time (e.g.~for many large
bodied mammals) we will average across generations and perhaps not observe
black swans. Furthermore, if we census populations infrequently relative to
generation time (e.g.~many insects in the GPDD) the recorded data may average
across extreme and less-extreme events and dampen black swan dynamics.

Our results suggest important future issues to address about ecological black
swans. Given that black swans can and do occur, can we forecast the probability
of black swans in space and time? Furthermore, what management policies allow
us to detect them quickly after they happen? Secondly, can we isolate the
components of ecological dynamics that experience black swans events by moving
from phenomenological models such as the Gompertz to mechanistic models, that
take into account, for example, recruitment? We expect that greater insight
into the mechanisms and covariates of ecological black swans may be best
obtained through specific geographic and taxonomic subsets of data where longer
time series are available \citep[e.g.][]{segura2013}. Finally, what is the
impact of allowing for black swans in forecasts of ecological risk? Financial
analysts are concerned with the shape of financial-return distribution tails
because these impact estimates of risk --- the probability of a specific
magnitude of undesired event occurring (REF). It is possible that a comparable
focus in ecology would alter our perception of ecological forecasts such as
extinction risk.

Policy implications

unlikely to forecast black swans, at least with any useful advanced warning
but we might be able to determine probabilities
and develop policy that is robust to, encourages rapid detection, and that is flexible enought to respond quickly to black swans

example of earch quakes - spatial planning, early warning systems, education systems, a general idea about the probability in given places, build buildings that are robust

Suggests that it's important to have policy that is robust to the uncertainty
about black swans and that can respond and adapt rapidly following black swans

foot and mouth disease and earthquakes?
