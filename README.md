# Black swans in ecological time series

This repository holds code for an in-progress analysis of heavy-tailed
population dynamics. This analysis is for a PhD thesis chapter and paper by
Sean Anderson, Trevor Branch, Andy Cooper, and Nick Dulvy.

The analysis can be run by sourcing the `.R` files in sequence
(`1-...R`, `2-...R`, etc.). Files that start with the same number can be 
sourced in any order.
