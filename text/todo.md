# --------------------

Letters: maximum of 5000 words in length (main text), and 6 figures, tables or
boxes.

Note: The specified word count is for the main text body excluding title,
abstract, acknowledgements, references, table and figure legends, and
appendices.

In identifying board members who might handle your manuscript we ask that you
only name in-conflict individuals and the reason why they are in conflict.

authors must confirm whether any of the data or content is already in the
public domain (e.g. in a publicly accessible pre-print repository or report),
and all relevant sources must be cited. Additionally once a paper is accepted,
in signing the CTA (Copyright Transfer Agreement) form the authors sign to
represent that the contribution has not been submitted elsewhere for
publication. Dual publication of an article is not permitted.

Any queries should be directed to the Managing Editor (Nathalie Espuno). This
journal is a member of and subscribes to the principles of the Committee on
Publication Ethics (COPE).

5. AUTHORSHIP

The title page must contain a brief statement of authorship, which will be
printed at the end of the article if it is accepted.

6. DATA SOURCES

Prior to submission of a manuscript, authors are responsible for having secured
any required permissions to use data in their study. It is the policy of
Ecology Letters that all published data sources must be referenced in the
manuscript. This reflects that data citations are important for the
reproducibility of research and as an incentive to make data publicly
available. In cases where there is both an original published paper and
a citation for the data set then both should be cited.

The covering letter to the Editorial Office should succinctly describe why the
enclosed work is novel, exciting and of general interest in ecology.

Additionally, the covering letter should include a clear statement of exactly
how the present manuscript is outstandingly novel relative to recent work by
the author or coauthors cited in the present submission.

I.  Title page Statement of authorship: Contributions by authors should be
listed on the title page and will be printed at the end of the manuscript. This
statement should be appropriate to the study described in the manuscript and
should clarify who designed the study, who performed the research, who provided
new methods or materials, and who wrote the manuscript. We encourage concise
statements such as “JW performed phylogenetic analyses, MH collected data,
performed modeling work and analyzed output data, and PK performed the
meta-analysis. MH wrote the first draft of the manuscript, and all authors
contributed substantially to revisions.”

Data accessibility statement: The statement must confirm that, should the
manuscript be accepted, the data supporting the results will be archived in an
appropriate public repository such as Dryad or Figshare and the data DOI will
be included at the end of the article.

The title page must also contain: - the article title - full name(s),
affiliation(s) and e-mail address(es) of all author(s) - a short running title
(abbreviated form of title) of less than 45 characters including spaces - up to
10 keywords for indexing purposes. It is very important that the keywords be
chosen carefully - the type of article (Ideas and Perspectives, Letters,
Reviews and Syntheses, or Technical Comments) - the number of words in the
abstract, the number of words in the main text (excluding abstract,
acknowledgements, references, table and figure legends), and the number of
words in each text box - the number of references - the number of figures,
tables, and text boxes - the name and complete mailing address (including
telephone and fax numbers and e-mail address) of the person to whom
correspondence should be sent

II. Abstract page The abstract page should contain a short summary not
exceeding 150 words for Letters, and 200 words for Ideas and Perspectives and
Reviews and Syntheses.

III. Main text (Sections b-d required for Letters only) (a) Introduction. The
introduction should summarize briefly the background and aims, and end with
a very brief statement of what has been achieved by the work.

(b) Material and methods. This section should contain sufficient detail so that
all procedures can be repeated (in conjunction with cited references).
A checklist is provided so that authors can check that their methods report
details which our editors regard as essential. This checklist is available
here. Where specific equipment and materials are named, the manufacturer's
name, city and country should be given (generally in parentheses after first
mention).

(c) Results. The Results section should present the experiments that support
the conclusions to be drawn later in the Discussion. The Results section should
conform to a high standard of rigour. Extended lines of inference, arguments or
speculations should not be placed in the Results.

(d) Discussion. The Discussion section should be separate from the Results
section. It allows authors to propose their interpretation of the results, and
to suggest what they might mean in a wider context. It should end with a clear
statement of the main conclusions of the research, and a clear explanation of
their importance and relevance.

(e) Acknowledgements. Acknowledgements should be brief and concise.

(f) References. See below for detailed information to in-text citations and
Reference list.

# Formatting

Files should be formatted double-spaced with no hyphenation or automatic
wordwrap (no hard returns within paragraphs).

Legends should be typed double-spaced and grouped at the end of the paper.

19. SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Supporting Information can be a useful way for an author to include important
but ancillary information with the article. Examples of Supporting Information
include additional tables, data sets, references cited within the Supporting
Information, figures, movie files (less than 5Mb), audio clips, 3D structures,
and other related nonessential multimedia files. Supporting Information should
be cited within the article text, and a descriptive legend should be included
in each Supporting Information file. It is published as supplied by the author,
and a proof is not made available prior to publication; for these reasons,
authors should provide any Supporting Information in the desired final format.

Note: Placing data sets in online supporting information should not be treated
as an alternative to depositing datasets in permanent public archives. Please
find full instructions on the preparation of Supporting Information for Ecology
Letters here. For further information on recommended file types and
requirements for submission, please visit: Author Services (Supporting
Information).
